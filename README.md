cd- This is a command that is used to change directories that you are in. you use it to go from a parent directory to a subdirectory. An example of this is if you were in the C:\ directory and wanted to go to the users directory, you would type "cd users" into the command line. This will change your active directory to the users directory and you can go further by typing the next directory contained inside the users directory.

mkdir- This command creates a new directory. You would use it if you wanted to create a new directory from inside the command line. If you were inside the C:\ directory and wanted to create a new "School" directory, you can type "mkdir School" to create a directory inside the C:\ directory. You can also use "mkdir School" to create a directory inside the C:\ directory. You can also use the "mkdir -p School/Homework". This will create a School directory that will be a parent directory for Homework. Then it will create the Homework directory inside School. 

cp- cp acts a copy paste command that will create an exact copy of a directory and paste it into the destination directory. This can be done with a single file, multiple files and even directories. You would use this if you want to make a back up of a directory before making an edit to the contents of it or to copy them to a removable drive. An example would be to locate a file Homework1 in the Homework directory. Once you locate the file, you can type "cp Homework1 Homework1SeanConroy F:\" which will make a copy of Homework1 and place it in the F:\ directory.

pwd- This command will print the full path of the current directory you are in. You would use this if you wanted to see where the directory you are working on is in your machine. You can use it like so: "pwd Homework1" this will then return "C:/Homework/Homework1". Now you are able to see exactly where the directory you are working on is located.
