cd- This is a command that is used to change directories that you are in. you use it to go from a parent directory to a subdirectory. An example of this is if you were in the C:\ directory and wanted to go to the users directory, you would type "cd users" into the command line. This will change your active directory to the users directory and you can go further by typing the next directory contained inside the users directory.

mkdir- This command creates a new directory. You would use it if you wanted to create a new directory from inside the command line. If you were inside the C:\ directory and wanted to create a new "School" directory, you can type "mkdir School" to create a directory inside the C:\ directory. You can also use "mkdir School" to create a directory inside the C:\ directory. You can also use the "mkdir -p School/Homework". This will create a School directory that will be a parent directory for Homework. Then it will create the Homework directory inside School.
