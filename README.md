cd- This is a command that is used to change directories that you are in. you use it to go from a parent directory to a subdirectory. An example of this is if you were in the C:\ directory and wanted to go to the users directory, you would type "cd users" into the command line. This will change your active directory to the users directory and you can go further by typing the next directory contained inside the users directory.
